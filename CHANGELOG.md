<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->


## [0.6.0] - 2022-11-01
## Added
- Changelog
- `rank` column added to output file
- `database.generate_decoys` parameter, which turns off internal decoy generation. This enables the use of FASTA databases for SearchGUI/PeptideShaker

### Changed
- Base ProForma v2 notation is used for peptide modifications, i.e. "\[+304.2071\]-PEPTIDEM\[+15.9949\]AAC\[+57.0214\]H"
- `scannr` column now contains the full nativeID/spectrum title from the mzML file, i.e. "controllerType=0 controllerNumber=1 scan=30069"
- `discriminant_score` column renamed to `sage_discriminant_score` for PeptideShaker recognition
- `database.decoy_prefix` JSON option changed to `database.decoy_tag`. This allows decoy tagging to occur anywhere within the accession: "sp|P01234_REVERSED|HUMAN"
- Output file renamed:  `results.pin` to `results.sage.tsv`
- Output file renamed: `quant.csv` to `quant.tsv`
- Rename `pin_paths` to `output_paths` in results.json file


## [0.5.0] - 2022-10-28
### Added
- Support for selenocysteine and pyrrolysine amino acids

## [0.5.0] - 2022-10-28
### Added
- Ability to directly read/write files from AWS S3

### Changed
- Processing files in parallel processes them in batches of `num_cpus / 2` to avoid memory issues
- Fixed bug where `protein_fdr` was erroneously assigned to `peptide_fdr` output field
- Additional parallelization for assignment of PEP, FDR, writing output files

## [0.4.0] - 2022-10-18
### Added
- Label free quantification can be enabled by turning on `quant.lfq` JSON parameter 
- Commmand line arguments can be used to override configuration file

## [0.3.1] - 2022-10-06
### Added
- Workflow contributions from [@wfondrie](https://github.com/wfondrie).

### Changed
- Don't parse empty MS2 spectra

## [0.3.0] - 2015-09-15
### Added
- Retention time prediction
- Ability to filter low-number b/y-ions for faster preliminary scoring (`database.min_ion_index` option)
- Ability to toggle retention time prediction (`predict_rt`)
